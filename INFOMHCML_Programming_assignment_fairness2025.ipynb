        "We see that we are able to train a pretty good classifier, with quite high accuracy, precision and recall. Therefore, the percentage of individuals predicted a zero is quite close to the base rate for both race values. However, this also means that chances of being assigned a zero is not equal for both races: we can see a statistical parity of 0.4495/0.6102 = 0.74. Considering a common treshold of 0.8, this means the classifier does not satisfy the fairness criterion of equal decision measures.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "We can see this inequallity when we devide the data on the sensitive attribute race. Since a high percentage of the African-Americans has a label of 1, our classifier shows some more difficulties in assigning them the label 0 compared to the Caucasian population. This is most noticeable in the recall: there is quite a differnce in the ability to assign all non-recidivism individuals a 0 between the two ethnicity groups, with African-Americans being more often wrongly assinged a 1.\n",
        "\n",
        "We would expect that removing the sensitive attribute column from the data would results in a decrease in this inequality of decision measures. After all, if the model is unable to see from which group an individual is from, it should prohibit decision making on race and force decsions on crimes alone. Therefore, individuals with similar crimes yet diffent races should be treated identical, therefore lowering the bias in the data and the statical parity.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, against our expectations, both models return identical predictions on the test data set. This means that peformance for the model with the sensitive attribute is the same as for the model that excludes race. Altough suprising, we believe it might highlight the fact that fairness is not achieved through unawareness: leaving out the race attribute is not a solution if its value is strongly correlated with the other features we use. If this is the case, these proxies can allow the model to still predict the race group without being able to see that specific column. Considering the models performance, we think that the crime data might be able to reflect the race data, e.g. because African-American individuals commit on average more serious crimes, making the column about the race itself redundant for optimal classification.\n"

This is, because with this more balanced distribution, the large difference in base rates (percentage of non-recidivism) should be leveled out for both groups. However, quite suprisingly, the model with these weights was unable to increase its performance. We believe this could be because the difference and not that large, resulting in weights quite close to 1. Therefore, it might be the case that this reweighing is not able to have the profound effect that can chance the decisions of the classifier."

        "The use of artificial decision making systems, especially in these high consequence fields such as the justice system, is an emerging trend accompanied with legitimate concerns about fairness. As we can see from our experiment, historical data can be biased, which limits the classifier's ability to make correct decisions for underrepresented subgroups. Furthermore, we saw that removing these biases, by excluding sensitive information or including sample weights, does not always has the profound performance increase in equality one might hope. Altough one might argue that accuracy can be valued above fairness, meaning a more WYSIWYG approach, we should not overlook the effect the models decisions have on human lives. Discriminatory models can maintain and even amplify exisiting historical biases, by directing human action in based on stereotypical believes.\n",
